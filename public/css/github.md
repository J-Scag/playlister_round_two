- Github repo

    - wanted to best emulate a proffesional environment
    - so used a team repo
      - forks to people githubs
      - clone locally
      - set upstream as the team repo

  - to make new feature or bugfix
      - fetch & merge from upstream
      - make new branch locally for feature
      - make feature
      - push feature branch to personal github repo
      - make pull request to team repo

    - teammates review and merge in the feature, never the person who 
      makes the feature
